Red recipes are those that have dependencies on Conda packages from
channels other than 'defaults', typically conda-forge and bioconda.

Red is a reminder that changes external to our systems will impact our
builds and deployments. These packages are safe to use in production,
but extra care needs to be taken when using them.
